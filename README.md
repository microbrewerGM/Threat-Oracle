# Threat-Oracle
Cyber Threat Model is an open-source project that empowers developers and infrastructure engineers to perform thorough threat modeling of applications, CI/CD pipelines, and runtime environments. It uses Neo4j's Bloom to build and visualize a digital twin of your application, enabling risk and threat identification through custom rules and CWE data.
