# Threat Oracle

## Introduction

Welcome to the Threat Oracle project! Threat Oracle is a threat modeling tool with a digital twin, graph structure, and vialuzation.

This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for threat modeling applications, CI/CD pipelines, and runtime environments. By building a digital twin of the application and infrastructure, we can visualize and analyze potential risks and threats. The digital twin is represented as a graph data structure, capturing data flows and interactions within the application. This graph twin is then matched to custom risk and threat rules or CWE data to discover vulnerabilities and potential threats.

## Features

- **Digital Twin Creation**: Build a digital twin of your application and infrastructure.
- **Graph Data Structure**: Represent the application and data flows as a graph.
- **Visualization**: Visualize the digital twin using Neo4j's Bloom.
- **Threat and Risk Analysis**: Match the graph twin to custom risk and threat rules or CWE data to discover vulnerabilities.

## Project Goals and Objectives

### Goals

1. **Comprehensive Threat Modeling**: Provide a robust platform for developers and infrastructure engineers to conduct thorough threat modeling of applications, CI/CD pipelines, and runtime environments.
2. **Digital Twin Creation**: Enable the creation of digital twins of applications and infrastructure to visualize data flows and interactions using a graph data structure.
3. **Visualization with Neo4j Bloom**: Utilize Neo4j's Bloom for intuitive and detailed visualization of the digital twin, aiding in better understanding and analysis.
4. **Risk and Threat Identification**: Facilitate the identification of risks and threats by matching the digital twin with custom risk and threat rules, as well as CWE data.

### Objectives

1. **Develop a Base Application Structure**: Establish a solid foundation for the project, including directory structures, initial files, and setup scripts.
2. **Define a Digital Twin Properties Schema**: Create a comprehensive schema that accurately represents the properties and relationships within the digital twin.
3. **Ensure Database Connectivity**: Implement robust database connectivity with Neo4j to support efficient data storage and retrieval.
4. **Integrate Graph Visualization**: Develop tools and examples for visualizing the digital twin using Neo4j Bloom, ensuring clarity and usability.
5. **Implement Threat and Risk Analysis**: Develop mechanisms to analyze the digital twin against custom rules and CWE data, providing actionable insights into potential vulnerabilities.
6. **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly update the platform with new features, performance enhancements, and security improvements based on community feedback and emerging threats.

By achieving these goals and objectives, Threat Oracle aims to be a valuable tool in the arsenal of developers and infrastructure engineers, helping them to proactively identify and mitigate security risks in their applications and environments.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/download/)
- [Neo4j Bloom](https://neo4j.com/bloom/)
- Python 3.x
- [Py2neo](https://py2neo.org/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/microbrewerGM/Threat-Oracle.git
    cd threat-oracle
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1. Initialize the digital twin properties schema:
    ```bash
    python initialize_schema.py
    ```

2. Connect to the Neo4j database:
    ```bash
    python connect_db.py
    ```

3. Visualize the digital twin:
    
    TBD - Navigate to Bloom.
