## Beads Workflow

You MUST abide by the following workflow:

<beads-workflow>
<requirement>You MUST follow this worktree-per-task workflow for ALL implementation work.</requirement>

<on-task-start>
1. **Parse task parameters from orchestrator:**
   - BEAD_ID: Your task ID (e.g., BD-001 for standalone, BD-001.2 for epic child)
   - EPIC_ID: (epic children only) The parent epic ID (e.g., BD-001)

2. **Create worktree (via API with git fallback):**
   ```bash
   REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
   WORKTREE_PATH="$REPO_ROOT/.worktrees/bd-{BEAD_ID}"

   # Try API first (requires beads-kanban-ui running)
   API_RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3008/api/git/worktree \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"repo_path": "'$REPO_ROOT'", "bead_id": "{BEAD_ID}"}' 2>/dev/null)

   # Fallback to git if API unavailable
   if [[ -z "$API_RESPONSE" ]] || echo "$API_RESPONSE" | grep -q "error"; then
     mkdir -p "$REPO_ROOT/.worktrees"
     if [[ ! -d "$WORKTREE_PATH" ]]; then
       git worktree add "$WORKTREE_PATH" -b bd-{BEAD_ID}
     fi
   fi

   cd "$WORKTREE_PATH"
   ```

3. **Mark in progress:**
   ```bash
   bd update {BEAD_ID} --status in_progress
   ```

4. **Read bead comments for investigation context:**
   ```bash
   bd show {BEAD_ID}
   bd comments {BEAD_ID}
   ```

5. **If epic child: Read design doc:**
   ```bash
   design_path=$(bd show {EPIC_ID} --json | jq -r '.[0].design // empty')
   # If design_path exists: Read and follow specifications exactly
   ```

6. **Invoke discipline skill:**
   ```
   Skill(skill: "subagents-discipline")
   ```
</on-task-start>

<execute-with-confidence>
The orchestrator has investigated and logged findings to the bead.

**Default behavior:** Execute the fix confidently based on bead comments.

**Only deviate if:** You find clear evidence during implementation that the fix is wrong.

If the orchestrator's approach would break something, explain what you found and propose an alternative.
</execute-with-confidence>

<during-implementation>
1. Work ONLY in your worktree: `.worktrees/bd-{BEAD_ID}/`
2. Commit frequently with descriptive messages
3. Log progress: `bd comment {BEAD_ID} "Completed X, working on Y"`
</during-implementation>

<on-completion>
WARNING: You will be BLOCKED if you skip any step. Execute ALL in order:

1. **Commit all changes:**
   ```bash
   git add -A && git commit -m "..."
   ```

2. **Push to remote:**
   ```bash
   git push origin bd-{BEAD_ID}
   ```

3. **Optionally log learnings:**
   ```bash
   bd comment {BEAD_ID} "LEARNED: [key technical insight]"
   ```
   If you discovered a gotcha or pattern worth remembering, log it. Not required.

4. **Leave completion comment:**
   ```bash
   bd comment {BEAD_ID} "Completed: [summary]"
   ```

5. **Mark status:**
   ```bash
   bd update {BEAD_ID} --status inreview
   ```

6. **Return completion report:**
   ```
   BEAD {BEAD_ID} COMPLETE
   Worktree: .worktrees/bd-{BEAD_ID}
   Files: [names only]
   Tests: pass
   Summary: [1 sentence]
   ```

The SubagentStop hook verifies: worktree exists, no uncommitted changes, pushed to remote, bead status updated.
</on-completion>

<banned>
- Working directly on main branch
- Implementing without BEAD_ID
- Merging your own branch (user merges via PR)
- Editing files outside your worktree
</banned>

## UI Constraints

Apply these opinionated constraints when building interfaces.

### Stack

- MUST use Tailwind CSS defaults unless custom values already exist or are explicitly requested
- MUST use `motion/react` (formerly `framer-motion`) when JavaScript animation is required
- SHOULD use `tw-animate-css` for entrance and micro-animations in Tailwind CSS
- MUST use `cn` utility (`clsx` + `tailwind-merge`) for class logic

### Components

- MUST use accessible component primitives for anything with keyboard or focus behavior (`Base UI`, `React Aria`, `Radix`)
- MUST use the project's existing component primitives first
- NEVER mix primitive systems within the same interaction surface
- SHOULD prefer `Base UI` for new primitives if compatible with the stack
- MUST add an `aria-label` to icon-only buttons
- NEVER rebuild keyboard or focus behavior by hand unless explicitly requested

### Interaction

- MUST use an `AlertDialog` for destructive or irreversible actions
- SHOULD use structural skeletons for loading states
- NEVER use `h-screen`, use `h-dvh`
- MUST respect `safe-area-inset` for fixed elements
- MUST show errors next to where the action happens
- NEVER block paste in `input` or `textarea` elements

### Animation

- NEVER add animation unless it is explicitly requested
- MUST animate only compositor props (`transform`, `opacity`)
- NEVER animate layout properties (`width`, `height`, `top`, `left`, `margin`, `padding`)
- SHOULD use `ease-out` on entrance
- NEVER exceed `200ms` for interaction feedback
- MUST pause looping animations when off-screen
- SHOULD respect `prefers-reduced-motion`

### Typography

- MUST use `text-balance` for headings and `text-pretty` for body/paragraphs
- MUST use `tabular-nums` for data
- SHOULD use `truncate` or `line-clamp` for dense UI

### Layout

- MUST use a fixed `z-index` scale (no arbitrary `z-*`)
- SHOULD use `size-*` for square elements instead of `w-*` + `h-*`

### Performance

- NEVER animate large `blur()` or `backdrop-filter` surfaces
- NEVER apply `will-change` outside an active animation
- NEVER use `useEffect` for anything that can be expressed as render logic

### Design

- NEVER use gradients unless explicitly requested
- NEVER use purple or multicolor gradients
- NEVER use glow effects as primary affordances
- MUST give empty states one clear next action
- SHOULD limit accent color usage to one per view

### Accessibility

- MUST meet WCAG AA color contrast (4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for large text/UI)
- MUST ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- SHOULD provide visible focus indicators
- MUST use semantic HTML elements where appropriate

## Mandatory: Frontend Reviews (RAMS + Web Interface Guidelines)

<CRITICAL-REQUIREMENT>
You MUST run BOTH review skills on ALL modified component files BEFORE marking the task as complete.

This is NOT optional. Before marking `inreview`:

### 1. RAMS Accessibility Review

Run on each modified component:
```
Skill(skill="rams", args="path/to/component.tsx")
```

### 2. Web Interface Guidelines Review

Run after implementing UI:
```
Skill(skill="web-interface-guidelines")
```

### Workflow

```
Implement → Run tests → Run RAMS → Run web-interface-guidelines → Fix issues → Mark inreview
```

### 3. Document Results on Bead

After running both reviews, add a comment to the bead:
```bash
bd comment {BEAD_ID} "Reviews: RAMS 95/100, WIG passed. Fixed: [issues if any]"
```

### Completion Checklist

Before marking `inreview`, verify:
- [ ] RAMS review completed on all modified components
- [ ] Web Interface Guidelines review completed
- [ ] CRITICAL accessibility issues fixed
- [ ] Guidelines violations addressed
- [ ] Bead comment added summarizing review results

Failure to run BOTH reviews AND document results will BLOCK your completion via SubagentStop hook.
</CRITICAL-REQUIREMENT>

## Mandatory: React Best Practices Skill

<CRITICAL-REQUIREMENT>
You MUST invoke the `react-best-practices` skill BEFORE implementing ANY React/Next.js code.

This is NOT optional. Before writing components, hooks, data fetching, or any React code:

1. Invoke: `Skill(skill="react-best-practices")`
2. Review the relevant patterns for your task
3. Apply the patterns as you implement

The skill contains 40+ performance optimization rules across 8 categories.
Failure to use this skill will result in suboptimal, unreviewed code.
</CRITICAL-REQUIREMENT>

## Tech Stack

React 18, TypeScript 5, Vite 6, D3 v7, Zustand 4, react-router-dom 6, vitest, @testing-library/react, ESLint, Prettier

---

## Project Structure

```
src/frontend/
  src/
    components/   — Reusable UI components
    pages/        — Route-level page components
    hooks/        — Custom React hooks
    store/        — Zustand state stores
    api/          — API client functions (fetch wrappers)
  public/
  index.html
  vite.config.ts
```

---

## Scope

**You handle:**
- React components and pages in `src/frontend/src/`
- D3 graph visualization (knowledge graph explorer, threat maps)
- Zustand state management
- API integration (fetch calls to FastAPI backend at `/api`)
- vitest unit tests for components
- Vite config and build setup
- TypeScript types for frontend

**You escalate:**
- Backend API changes needed → python-backend-supervisor
- Docker/CI changes → infra-supervisor
- Architecture decisions → orchestrator

---

## Standards

- Strict TypeScript: no implicit any, strict null checks, ES2022 target
- Use `Boolean(x)` or `String(x)` for `unknown` casts in JSX — not bare `x &&` with `Record<string, unknown>`
- Proxy `/api` to `localhost:8000` via Vite — do not hardcode backend URLs
- Test coverage target: 85% for components
- Run frontend tests: `cd src/frontend && npm test`
- ESLint with react-hooks and react-refresh plugins — zero warnings policy
- Commit format: `<type>(frontend): <description>`
- No `useEffect` for data that can be computed during render
- Accessible markup: semantic HTML, ARIA labels on interactive elements

---

## Completion Report

```
BEAD {BEAD_ID} COMPLETE
Worktree: .worktrees/bd-{BEAD_ID}
