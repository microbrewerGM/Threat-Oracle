# Threat Oracle Development Plan

This document outlines our approach to developing Threat Oracle in small, manageable increments while incorporating best practices from the start.

## Development Philosophy

We will follow these principles:

1. **Start Small, Iterate Often**: Begin with the simplest possible implementation that provides value, then iterate.
2. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementing features.
3. **Documentation First**: Document the expected behavior before writing code.
4. **API-First Design**: Design APIs before implementing them.
5. **Continuous Integration**: Automate testing and deployment from the beginning.

## Implementing Best Practices

### Version Control with Git

- Use feature branches for all new development
- Create meaningful commit messages
- Review code before merging to main
- Tag releases with semantic versioning

### Documentation

- Use docstrings for all functions, classes, and modules
- Keep README.md updated with current project status
- Maintain separate documentation for API, schema, and user guides
- Generate documentation automatically as part of the build process

### Testing

- Write unit tests for all new code
- Aim for high test coverage (>80%)
- Include integration tests for key features
- Set up automated testing in CI/CD pipeline

### Code Quality

- Use a linter (e.g., ESLint for JS/TS, Pylint for Python)
- Use a code formatter (e.g., Prettier for JS/TS, Black for Python)
- Enforce consistent coding standards
- Perform regular code reviews

### Changelog and Interaction Log

- Update CHANGELOG.md for each release
- Record significant changes, additions, and fixes
- Maintain INTERACTION_LOG.md to document developer and LLM interactions
- Use these logs to track project evolution and decision-making

### Secrets Management

- Never commit secrets to the repository
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Consider using a secrets management tool for production
- Document the process for managing secrets

### API-First Approach

- Design APIs before implementing features
- Create OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- Validate API design through reviews
- Test APIs independently of UI

## Getting Started

To begin implementing this plan:

1. Set up the basic project structure
2. Implement the core schema interface
3. Create the first test cases
4. Set up the documentation framework
5. Establish the CI/CD pipeline

By following this incremental approach and incorporating best practices from the start, we'll build a solid foundation for Threat Oracle while making steady, visible progress.
