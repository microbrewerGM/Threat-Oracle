# Threat Oracle

## Introduction

Welcome to the Threat Oracle project! Threat Oracle is a threat modeling tool with a digital twin, graph structure, and visualization.

This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for threat modeling applications, CI/CD pipelines, and runtime environments. By building a digital twin of the application and infrastructure, we can visualize and analyze potential risks and threats. The digital twin is represented as a graph data structure, capturing data flows and interactions within the application. This graph twin is then matched to custom risk and threat rules or CWE data to discover vulnerabilities and potential threats.

## Features

- **Digital Twin Creation**: Build a digital twin of your application and infrastructure.
- **Graph Data Structure**: Represent the application and data flows as a graph.
- **Visualization**: Visualize the digital twin.
- **Threat and Risk Analysis**: Match the graph twin to custom risk and threat rules or CWE data to discover weaknesses and potential threats vectors.

## Project Goals and Objectives

### Goals

1. **Comprehensive Threat Modeling**: Provide a robust platform for developers and infrastructure engineers to conduct thorough threat modeling of applications, CI/CD pipelines, and runtime environments.
2. **Digital Twin Creation**: Enable the creation of digital twins of applications and infrastructure to visualize data flows and interactions using a graph data structure.
3. **Visualization with Neo4j Bloom**: Utilize a web interface for an intuitive and detailed visualization of the digital twin, aiding in better understanding and analysis.
4. **Risk and Threat Identification**: Facilitate the identification of risks and threats by matching the digital twin with custom risk and threat rules, as well as CWE data.

### Objectives

1. **Develop a Base Application Structure**: Establish a solid foundation for the project, including directory structures, initial files, and setup scripts.
2. **Define a Digital Twin Properties Schema**: Create a comprehensive schema that accurately represents the properties and relationships within the digital twin.
3. **Integrate Graph Visualization**: Develop tools and examples for visualizing the digital twin, ensuring clarity and usability.
4. **Implement Threat and Risk Analysis**: Develop mechanisms to analyze the digital twin against custom rules and possibly CWE data, providing actionable insights into potential vulnerabilities.
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly update the platform with new features, performance enhancements, and security improvements based on community feedback and emerging threats.

By achieving these goals and objectives, Threat Oracle aims to be a valuable tool in the arsenal of developers and infrastructure engineers, helping them to proactively identify and mitigate security risks in their applications and environments.

## Roadmap

### Develop Schema and Model

- [ ] Define schema for nodes (technical assets, objects)
- [ ] Define schema for edges (communication links between technical assets, objects)
- [ ] Define schema for data assets (data processed, stored by or transmitted between technical assets/objects)
- [ ] Define schema for data flows (data flows between technical assets/objects)

### Establish Great Programming Practices

- [ ] Secure best practices for handling secrets
- [ ] Version control with Git
- [ ] Document code with docstrings
- [ ] Use a linter and code formatter
- [ ] Build documentation before deploying code
- [ ] Build a changelog file and update it for each commit, PR, and release
- [ ] Record developer and Cline LLM interactions in a summary file that is formatted similar to a changelog
- [ ] Build and deploy a CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Use a testing framework
- [ ] Write unit tests and execute in pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Use a logging framework
- [ ] Use an API first approach

### Planning Phase

- [ ] Define project approach
- [ ] Define project structure
- [ ] Define project documentation
- [ ] Define project testing
- [ ] Define project deployment
- [ ] Define project monitoring
- [ ] Define project logging
- [ ] Define technology stack

### Start Development

- [ ] Create a new branch
- [ ] Start development with the first feature
- [ ] Test and validate the feature
- [ ] Document the feature
- [ ] Commit and push the feature to the branch
- [ ] Create a pull request
- [ ] Get the pull request approved
- [ ] Merge the pull request into the main branch
- [ ] Repeat for each feature

### Future Features Not in Scope

#### Threat and Risk Analysis

- [ ] Develop custom risk and threat rules
- [ ] Integrate CWE data
- [ ] Implement threat and risk analysis
