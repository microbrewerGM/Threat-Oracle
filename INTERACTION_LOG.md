# Developer and LLM Interaction Log

This document records significant interactions between developers and LLM assistants (like Cline) during the development of Threat Oracle. It serves as a record of key decisions, brainstorming sessions, and problem-solving approaches.

## Format

Each entry should include:
- **Date**: When the interaction occurred
- **Participants**: Who was involved (developer names, LLM assistant name)
- **Topic**: Brief description of what was discussed
- **Key Points**: Major insights, decisions, or questions
- **Outcome**: What resulted from the interaction
- **Follow-up Actions**: Any tasks or further investigation needed

## Interactions

### 2025-03-22: Architecture and Design Planning

**Participants**: Aaron Smith, Cline

**Topic**: Creating a comprehensive software architecture and design document

**Key Points**:
- Defined a microservices architecture approach
- Outlined component architecture for frontend, backend, and schema service
- Detailed the graph data model with nodes and edges
- Mapped features to architectural components
- Specified deployment strategies for local, containerized, and Kubernetes environments
- Addressed security, performance, and monitoring considerations

**Outcome**:
- Created ARCHITECTURE.md with detailed software architecture and design
- Updated CHANGELOG.md to reflect the new document

**Follow-up Actions**:
- Review architecture document for alignment with project goals
- Begin implementing the core components based on the architecture
- Set up the initial development environment

### 2025-03-22: Project Vision Refinement

**Participants**: Aaron Smith, Cline

**Topic**: Refining the project vision and planning initial development approach

**Key Points**:
- Discussed the need for a more accessible threat modeling tool
- Identified key differentiators from existing tools:
  - Visual-first, schema-backed, graph-based approach
  - Eventual LLM/voice query integration
  - Automatic model generation from code repositories
  - Flexible schema for modeling various aspects
- Defined target audience (initially security and software architects, expanding to business users)
- Outlined technical vision (web-based, modern JS/TS, graph visualization, database options)
- Discussed graph structure with core entity types and relationships

**Outcome**:
- Enhanced README.md with clearer project vision
- Created DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md with incremental approach to feature implementation
- Set up initial project structure with best practices in mind
- Established .gitignore, CHANGELOG.md, and INTERACTION_LOG.md

**Follow-up Actions**:
- Set up basic project structure
- Implement core schema interface
- Create initial test cases
- Set up documentation framework
- Establish CI/CD pipeline
